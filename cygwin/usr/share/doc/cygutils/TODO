* Update lpr.cc and mkshortcut.c to use cygwin-1.7 cygwin_conv_path
  instead of deprecated cygwin_conv_to_win32_path.

* Update (some?) utilities to handle unicode filenames, similar to
  IWAMURO Motonori's work on cygstart.


* This package doesn't really DO anything with the configure results.
  If certain libraries aren't found, then some programs shouldn't be
  built. Ditto certain functions.  But right now, everything that is
  needed is checked for in configure, but no adjustments are made
  to accomodate those results -- make will just fail.  This is surely
  not the right way to do things.

* What to do about wacky windows includes?  <shlobj.h> etc?

* GPLv3 conversion:
  - banner is GPLv2 only. Contact original author.
  - lpr is GPLv2 only. Contact original author.
  - readshortcut is GPLv2 only. Contact original author.
  - realpath is GPLv2+, but courtesy contact original author
  - cygstart is GPLv2+, but courtesy contact original author
  - cygdrop is GPLv2+, but courtesy contact original author
  - mkshortcut is GPLv2+, but courtesy contact original author
  - cygicons.dll compilation is GPLv2+, but includes artwork that
    is unspecified GPL. Need to research whether this can be upgraded.
